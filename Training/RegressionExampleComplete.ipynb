    "# Predicting house prices: a regression example\n",

    "We’ll attempt to predict the median price of homes in a given Boston suburb in the mid-1970s, given data points about the suburb at the time, such as the crime rate, the local property tax rate, and so on. It has relatively few data points: only 506, split between 404 training samples and 102 test samples. And each feature in the input data (for example, the crime rate) has a different scale. For instance, some values are pro- portions, which take values between 0 and 1; others take values between 1 and 12, others between 0 and 100, and so on."

    "It would be problematic to feed into a neural network values that all take wildly differ- ent ranges. The network might be able to automatically adapt to such heterogeneous data, but it would definitely make learning more difficult. A widespread best practice to deal with such data is to do feature-wise normalization: for each feature in the input divide by the standard deviation, so that the feature is centered around 0 and has a unit standard deviation. This is easily done in Numpy.\n"

    "### Validating your approach using K-fold validation\n",
    "To evaluate your networ while you keep adjusting its parameters (such as the number of epochs used for training), you could split the data into a training set and a validation set, as you did in the previous examples. But because you have so few data points, the validation set would end up being very small (for instance, about 100 examples). As a consequence, the validation scores might change a lot depending on which data points you chose to use for validation and which you chose for training: the validation scores might have a high variance with regard to the validation split. This would prevent you from reliably evaluating your model. The best practice in such situations is to use K -fold cross-validation. It consists of splitting the available data into K partitions (typically K = 4 or 5), instantiating K identical models, and training each one on K – 1 partitions while evaluating on the remaining partition. The validation score for the model used is then the average of the K validation scores obtained. In terms of code, this is straightforward"
